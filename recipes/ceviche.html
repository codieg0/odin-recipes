    <h3>A little description</h3>
    <p>Ceviche, cebiche, sebiche, or seviche[a] (Spanish pronunciation: [seβitʃe]) is a dish consisting of fish or shellfish marinated in citrus and seasonings, and is recognized by UNESCO as an expression of Peruvian traditional cuisine and Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Different versions of ceviche are part of the culinary culture of various Spanish-American countries along the Pacific Ocean[4] where each one is native: Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama and Peru. In Peru it is also considered a flagship dish and cultural heritage..</p>

    <p>The fish is typically cured in lemon or sour lime juice, although sour orange was historically used. The dressing also includes some local variety of chili pepper or chili, replaced by mustard in some locations in Central America. The meat is usually marinated together with sliced or chopped onion and served with chopped cilantro. In Mexico, tomato and avocado are also usually included,[6][7] and the addition of tomato sauce is common except in Chile, Panama and Peru.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>White fish</li>
        <li>Lime</li>
        <li>Herbs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Marinate the fish</strong>. In a glass (non-reactive) bowl, stir together the fish, lime juice, and lemon juice. Cover the bowl and marinate in the fridge for 20 to 30 minutes (and up until str2 hours or so). You’ll notice the fish go opaque as the lime juice “cooks” the fish. The longer you marinate the fish, the more it will cook. See below for more information.</li>
        <li><strong>Stir everything together</strong>. Remove the fish from the fridge (no need to drain it) and add the tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, red onion, jalapeno pepper, cilantro, and salt. Gently stir to combine.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve it up!</strong> Serve the ceviche in individual glasses, on a plate, or with tortilla chips.</li>
